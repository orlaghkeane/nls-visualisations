# nls-visualisations
This repo contains a web app which was produced as part of my Honours project, ‘Visualising the National Library of Scotland’s Publication Data’.  This project involved creating meaningful data visualisations for exploring and discovering books and authors within the National Library of Scotland’s metadata collection of publications.
